# TypeORM-NodeJS-Assignment
Very basic backend app with a single entity Customer (id, name, phone). I should be able to create a new customer, get list of customers, get customer by id and request by phone or name. Stack: Node, Express, TS, SQLite, TypeORM Just build very basic setup according my requirements, no need for super heavy logic.
